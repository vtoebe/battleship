---------------------------------------------
When starting the game, Player 1 must choose
his enemy, which can be another Player or
the Machine.

Each Player has a board with 10 ships, as it
is not allowed to view each other's board, in
case of Player vs Player, they will only see
the boards at the end of the game.

The game has 20 rounds where the Players
shoot alternately, informing the shot's
coordinates, as follows:
Line (A, B, C... J)
Column (0, 1, 2... 9)

The player who hits all or the greatest 
number of ships wins.
